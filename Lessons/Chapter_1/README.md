## Download and install software

- For our environment we will be using VSC, NODE, and GIT BASH
    - [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - Download for Windows (Stable Build)
    - VSCode, an integrated development environment (IDE), is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.
    - [Download NODE.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    - Download for Windows (LTS)
    - Node. js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. In short, it is what helps you run and control your application.
    - [Download GIT BASH](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - Download the newest release for Windows.
    - Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
